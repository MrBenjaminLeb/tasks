        "The Fourier transform is more commonl known for its applications in digital signal processing and image processing but essentially the fourier transform enables the transformation between a polynomial and sample representation of data. The ability to represent a polynomial in  both polynomial form:\n",

        "$$f(x) = a_{0}x_{0} + a_{1}x_{1}+ ...+a_{n}x_{n}$$\n",

        "$$X = <x_{0}, x_{1},...,x_{n}>$$\n",
        "\n",
        "and samples form:\n",
        "$$<(x,y)_{1}, (x,y)_{2}, ...,(x,y)_{n+1}$$\n",

        "has its advantages. As explored in the previous task of `basic python programming` vectorized sample data has computational advantages, expecially when certain operations  are done to them like multiplication. Polynomial expression has the advantage of faster evaluation operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to represent a polynomial in its vectorized sample form, $n+1$ descrete points are required where $n$ represents the order of the polynomial. A polynomial can also be represented with its roots, but performing operations in this form is more computationally complex and difficult to conceptualize.\n",

If there was a way to convert the polynomial in $O(n\\log n)$ as to the vectorized representation, as the fast fourier transform claims to do, this same operation woud only take 30 seconds .\n",

        "A possible strategy would be to merely evaluate $n+1$ points fom the polynomal resulting in a vector. This done naively would also result in $O(n^{2})$ operations, even after applying [Horner's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horner%27s_method).\n",
        "\n",
        "The Descrete Fourier Transform exploits the relationship between polynomial coefficients and these vectorized samples. By applying a forula to the vector of coefficients $A$ the out put of the computations would be the target vector $X$.\n",

        "\n",
        "Unrtunately this evaluation also amounts to $O(n^{2})$ expense. This lead to the development of the fast fourier transform. This implimentation exploits the relationship between numbers and their roots andreducing the coeffiient set to excecute the [divide and conquer algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_conquer_algorithm).  A set $W$ can be represented as a new set $W_{\\frac{1}{2}}$ thats half the size of $W$ if all its constituents are the roots of the original set.  \n",
        "\n",
        "The [fundimental theorem of algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_algebra) explains that all polynomals have at least $p$ number of roots. This enables us to reduce our $W$ vector to $W_{\\frac{1}{2}}$ as long as each variable  $w$ can be represented by its root in the original set. The vector of polynomial coefficients can autonimously be devided into 2 lists of even and odd indicies of the original vector $A$, with half its size.\n",
        "\n",

        "Since we are dealing with the roots of unity, in order or the set to consecutively half with each iteration, we can apply the followig formula:\n",
